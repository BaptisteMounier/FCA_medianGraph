## Done
* Take a unknow context
* Convert it into a standard context
* Create distributive context from strandard
** Use cla2018 algorithm to convert contexts of first filters into distributives contexts
** Merge result basically (local result of cla2018)
** Merge result (optimal result of cla2018)
*** Work on cla2018
*** Don't work on a crown lattice
## To do
* Adjust method to get distributive lattice of a crown from itself
