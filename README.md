## Done
* Take a unknow context
* Convert it into a standard context
* Create distributive first filters context from global strandard
  * Use cla2018 algorithm to convert contexts of first filters into distributives contexts
  * Merge result basically (local result of cla2018)
  * Merge result (optimal result of cla2018)
    * Work on cla2018
    * Don't work on a lattice with more than two first filters
## To do
* Adjust method to get distributive lattice of one with more than two first filters
* Adjust method to get distributive lattice of a crown from itself
## Problems
* Basic method doesn't work on lattice with more than two first filters
