# FCA_medianGraph
## Datas set
* cla_v1: example in cla
* cla_v2: example in cla with one additionnal n5 on the commun axe
* cla_v3: two examples of cal side by side

# Reporting
## Done
* Take a unknow context
  * Create the graph (with Graphviz)
* Convert it into a standard context
* Convert it into a distributive context
  * ?
* Create distributive first filters context from global strandard one
  * Use cla2018 algorithm to convert contexts of first filters into distributives contexts
  * Merge result basically (local result of cla2018)
  * Merge similar nodes (optimal result of cla2018)
## To do
* Need to verify merge method on lattice with cross-connections (like crown)
* Enable export for Latviz and others main graphs generators applications
* Create GUI
## Problems
* Can be a problem with lattice with cross-connections (like crown)
